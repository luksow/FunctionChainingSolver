# FunctionChainingSolver

Simple one-file solver that given list of functions (X1 -> Y1, X2 -> Y2, ..., Xn -> Yn) and two types T and R finds a path that X1 =:= T, Yn =:= R and Yk =:= X(k + 1). To put it informally, you give functions (funs), expected input (T) and output type (R) and solver finds feasible function composition T -> R using funs. This project is probably useless and served me as a way to play with Scala's reflection.
